       " 'description': 'For those searching for that unique property with vision toward the life well-lived, a postmodern architectural awaits. Hip, relaxed, refined with a stylistic identity all its own crowning an expansive 8,100 square foot lot in the most sought after pocket in Valley Village. Alluding to the style and design of an Aspen mountain chalet, the property is the epitome of peaceful seclusion residing in divine harmony with its organic environment of towering trees and verdant greenery. Massive walls of glass beautifully bridge the aesthetic divide between structure and nature, bringing the outdoors in and suffusing the space in an abundance of natural light. Vaulted beamed ceilings soar above a floor plan that flows with ease designed for contemporary living and entertaining. The post and beam covered brick patio and expansive back lawn epitomize the Southern California lifestyle of endless al fresco leisure and outdoor entertaining. Highlights include freshly painted interiors, skylit kitchen with breakfast bar, a secret hidden bonus room, and a newly built 2-car detached garage with built-in storage and glass doors that easily doubles as a multi-use flex space. Three bedrooms including a primary suite with cozy fireplace round out the comfortable accommodations. Located in an idyllic, picturesque tree lined street just moments from the award winning Colfax Charter School District, beloved Valley Village Park, Disney, Warner Bros. CBS, NBC and Universal Studios and the famed NoHo Arts District. This is the place where you want to live. Welcome!',\n",
